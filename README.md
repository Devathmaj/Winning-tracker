---

## ⚙️ Configuration

-   `DISCORD_TOKEN` (Required): Your Discord application's bot token.
-   `MONGO_URI` (Required for local setup): The connection string for your MongoDB database.

---

## 📝 Usage

-   `/initialize`: Starts a new tracking session in the channel.
-   `/result`: Ends the session, displays a summary, and saves it to the database.

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

-   **Bot is offline:**
    -   Check the container logs with `docker-compose logs -f bot`.
    -   Ensure your `DISCORD_TOKEN` is correct in the `.env` file.
    -   Verify that the Docker containers are running with `docker-compose ps`.
-   **Slash commands not appearing:**
    -   It can take Discord up to an hour to register slash commands globally. Try reinviting the bot to your server with the correct OAuth2 URL.
    -   Ensure the bot was invited with the `applications.commands` scope.
-   **Data not being tracked:**
    -   Confirm the bot has `Read Message History` and `View Channels` permissions in the target channel.
    -   Make sure you have started a session with `/initialize`.
